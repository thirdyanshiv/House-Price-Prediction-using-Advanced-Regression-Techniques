# House Price Prediction using Advanced Regression Techniques
# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. The dataset used is the Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset, which includes 79 features describing various aspects of residential homes. The goal is to build a robust regression model to predict the sale price of houses.
